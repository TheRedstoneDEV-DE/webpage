    <h2>## About me</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>Hi, I'm Robert R. aka. TheRedstoneDEV_DE, I'm interrested in Linux, software development and music production.
        I use my spare time for developing some software projects with my friend <a class="lnk"
          href="https://marcel-hurban.com/">Devellight</a> and I'm also getting started in game-development for our
        future project, for which I did also to get into some music production and 3D modeling, which I both really
        enjoy.
        In terms of programming languages I write Java, C++, Rust, Python, Bash and some Lua, but I'd only consider Java
        as nearly completed and Rust might get to the same level as Java in the future.</p>
      <p>I am also using Linux as my daily driver and haven't even used Windows as that any time before, since I grew up
        with my first ever PC running Linux.
        NixOS is the Distro I've landed on now, since I moved away from Kubuntu, which was my first Distro, since the
        NVidia drivers and Wayland were not working properly.
        After that I settled on Arch Linux for a bit, before it became too unstable and I finally switched over to
        NixOS, on which I'll probably stay for longer.
        I also run a small Homelab consisting of three servers with some specific usecases and have some experience
        setting up a reverse proxy, configuring firewalls and setting up some more specific services.
      </p>

    <h2>## News</h2>
    <h3>### Version 1.4 of JaviVoiceAssistant released! It is alive!</h3>
    <a class="text">
      The new update covers an integration for LLMs into the voice assistant, it should be pin-compatible with the
      OpenAI's openAPI, but it has only been tested with the GPT4All API.
